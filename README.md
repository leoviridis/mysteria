This is a toy messenger, using a toy kind of Kademlia DHT for contact and peer search, having some (insecure, just to have it) encryption for instant and email messages, personal and group communications.
By email here something similar to usenet articles is meant, replicating between users.
By instant messages something, well, instant, similar to IRC, without history storage and replication.

It's written in Tcl/Tk, is literally a few thousand lines in one file, because that's how my focus worked at that moment.

No complaints are accepted.

Tested only on FreeBSD.
